## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-22

### Added
- **Core Framework**
  - Cross-species primate face detection using mmdetection
  - 68-point facial landmark estimation with mmpose
  - Support for multiple primate species (macaques, marmosets, lemurs, chimpanzees, etc.)
  - COCO format annotations for standardized data handling

- **Model Support**
  - Integration with MMDetection and MMPose frameworks
  - Ultralytics YOLO support for real-time inference
  - DeepLabCut and SLEAP integration for behavioral analysis
  - Pre-trained models optimized for primate faces

- **Tools & Features**
  - Interactive GUI for pseudo-labeling and annotation refinement
  - DINOv2 feature extraction for unsupervised analysis
  - Landmark converter for 68â†’49 point format conversion
  - Parallel GPU processing for large-scale video analysis
  - Temporal smoothing for stable video tracking

- **Documentation & Examples**
  - 6 interactive Jupyter notebook tutorials
  - Comprehensive API documentation
  - Installation guides for multiple platforms
  - Example scripts for common workflows

### Known Issues
