## PrimateFace: Cross-Species Primate Facial Analysis

Our research presents novel methods for advanced primate facial analysis across multiple species.

## Abstract

Coming soon - our paper is currently under review.

## Key Contributions

1. **Cross-Species Dataset**: The largest annotated dataset of primate faces spanning multiple species
2. **Unified Architecture**: A single model architecture that generalizes across primate species
3. **Benchmark Results**: State-of-the-art performance on primate face detection and landmark localization
4. **Open Source Tools**: Complete pipeline for primate facial analysis research

## Methods

### Architecture

Our approach uses a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes for:
- Face detection
- Landmark localization  
- Species classification

### Training Data

- Dataset size and composition details
- Annotation methodology
- Quality control procedures

### Evaluation

Comprehensive evaluation across:
- Multiple primate species
- Various lighting conditions
- Different poses and expressions
- Wild vs. captive settings

## Results

Performance metrics and comparisons will be available upon publication.

## Preprint

The preprint will be available on arXiv soon.
